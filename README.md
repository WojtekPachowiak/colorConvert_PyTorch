# Emulating RGB to HSV conversion using a neural network (pytorch)

```python main.py```

then change the path of the model on which to make prediction. 

Finally run:

```pyton eval.py ``` 

and voila! You should see a plot (the bottom one) showing the result of converting from RGB yo HSV by NN and then converting this HSV back to RGB using matplotlib's function.
